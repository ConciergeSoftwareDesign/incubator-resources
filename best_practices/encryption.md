Encryption
============

Encryption is to be used at all times when transmitting anything more sensitive than your first name. 

Why? Privacy and security. 

We work with a lot of 3rd parties. When sending or recieving info such as Secret Keys or Passwords, use a secure sending service like [Boveda.](bovedahq.com) Do not send sensitive information in plaintext.

# Causes

## Overview

We try to promote net and software freedom within our culture. Basically, "Don't be evil." Below are resources to get involved. 

## Donate without cost to you

- [AmazonSmile](http://smile.amazon.com/) - Make a donation with each purchase at zero cost to you. Choose the organisation to support. We recommend the EFF or Linux Foundation.

- [Search with DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) - Not only does this search engine not track you, but they also make large donations of their profits to great technology foundations supporting a free and open net. Also DDG has amazing !bang functions. e.g. !g will just run a google search (but anonymous). !gh will search github. !w will search wikipedia. The !bangs also function as bookmarks, so if you ever want to go to GitHub, you can just search !gh and it'll take you there. It's like having a set of search engines stored universally, accessible from any device with web access.

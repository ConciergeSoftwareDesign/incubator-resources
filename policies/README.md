## General Policies

### Work hours
We are a remote team that favours progress and results over set hours. You may, for example, work from midnight to 8am if you desire to. 

These freedoms do come with conditions:

- You must make yourself available for the 10 a.m. EST standup meeting.
- You must make yourself available for any normal workday calls which may regard your position in the team. 
- We encourage you to spend any free time you have doing research, contributing to open source projects, working on your 20% time projects, and optimizing tasks, code, whatever! This comes with the condition that your main responsibilities are managed and handled first.


### Paid and unpaid holiday

During your first and second year of employment, you are allowed up to 2 weeks of paid vacation. In your third year of employment, you are allowed up to 3 weeks of paid vacation. Vacation allowance will reset annually. If you start mid-year, vacation is pro-rated (e.g. If you start Q4, .25 * 2 weeks of paid vacation is allotted). 

Please give advanced notice so we can account for the time you will be out of the office and adjust where work is allocated. We do not guarantee any vacation time with less than 2 weeks advanced notice. At least 1 month advanced notice is preferable because it enables the team to sufficiently plan for your absence and smiley faces are given. 

Whilst we do not monitor the hours that you work and you're free to set your own schedule, taking time off for holiday without notification could result in a [Concern Report.](../processes/hr/employee_concern_report.md)

There is no limit to the amount of sick days taken unless an abusive pattern becomes apparent. 

### Equipment 

Each employee is allotted a $1500 stipend for needed equipment every 3 years. This may be used all at once or over the course of that period. (This amount is flexible and depends on needs. Please speato your manager if you require something to perform your work.)

### Education

In an effort to help you all meet your professional goals for the next quarter, the company has agreed to pay for your education through approved educational programs and efforts. As with most educational programs, this would be study completed in your own time. It's exciting to be able to offer you the opportunity to grow, but also remember that partner projects are your priority. If you have finished all you can for the current time, then by all means use your extra time to study or work through exercises, however education is normally an extracurricular activity.

To enroll on or enquire about an educational program, speak with Cody or Vince about the opportunities and programs available.

- The matter is kept private.

- To make suggestions about how to improve.
- Allow time for the employee to make improvements.

#### Termination

Codelitt reserves the right to terminate employment for any reason, however, most terminations are due to issues stated above and unlikely to be a surprise. If you're concerned that you're not meeting the requirements of employment here, please speak with a manager.

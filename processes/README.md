General Processes 
====================

## Asset management 

We have three systems in use for our asset management. 

- Google Drive - General docs and storage
- Box - Design assets and storage 
- Git - Dev assets and storage 

### Google Drive

The general folder structure should be fairly straight forward, but here is a brief overview of everything. 

- *Client projects* - Client project specific docs and resources should go here
- *Codelitt projects* - 20% project specific docs
- *Codelitt Processes-Policies-Metrics* - Anything regarding company wide general information and processes go here. We also try to make most of this available in this git repo, but sometimes for those not familiar with git, Drive can be a handy place to collaborate. 
	- *Codelitt reviews* - This is not a generally available folder. Employee reviews and goal setting should go here.
- *HR* - This is not available to everyone. All employee related records and documents should go here.  	
- *Marketing* - Marketing related strategy, docs, research, etc
- *Sales* - Sales strategy and research

### Box

### Github

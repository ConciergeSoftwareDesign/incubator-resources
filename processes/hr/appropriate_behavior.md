Appropriate Behaviour
=======================

While we've had a great deal of luck with everyone on our team being very respectful, over time there's always the chance that an individual or a group is not. 

When you encounter any inappropriate behavior, your first course of action, should be to speak to your manager and report this conduct. If you feel more comfortable speaking to someone else who is not your direct manager, we have managers from all walks of life who you are welcome to speak to. As we grow, this will be replaced with an HR representative.

If you do not feel comfortable coming forward in person, then we've also provided an anonymous form where you can voice your concern. You can find the form here: http://goo.gl/forms/yWohi8bbHG

Your concern will be addressed. We care about you feeling comfortable and happy in your workplace.

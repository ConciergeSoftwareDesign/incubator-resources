Employee reviews
================

## Philosophy
We believe that we are all our harshest critics. Codelitt Incubator and companies strive hard to hire the best people and we think that part of being "the best" includes being constructively critical for your areas of strength and areas that need improvement. Because we have a fairly flat hierarchy, a senior person just sits in on the review conversation and helps ask questions to drive thinking and offer suggestions, but the employee is ultimately responsible for their review. 

Below we've included an example of the document generated by a quarterly review.

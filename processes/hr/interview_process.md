Interview Process
======================
Are you nervous?

Don't be! 

## Philosophy
We believe that people are the most important part of a company. A very talented team with people who are truly passionate about what they do, is the foundation for a great product. 

## The process
The process should be very lean and should allow the candidates to have a direct contact with the team he/she would be working with. We look for skilled and interesting people. It's important to bring strong technical knowledge, but it's as important to bring *more than* technical knowledge to the table. 

#### 1st Interview - We need to know you

This will be the first interview.

* Basic info
* Experience
* What do you like to do?
* What makes you different?
* What can you bring to our team?
* What is a recent project you've worked on? 
* What are you passionate about? What causes do you advocate for? (Open source, net neutrality, freedom to puppies, etc)

#### 2nd Interview - Let's get practical (Engineering, design, or management team)

This will be your second interview. The specific exercises depend on the position, however, they will be hands on. 

* Show us what you can do
  * Do you have an amazing work to show?
  * Do you have any code sample?
  * No? That's fine, we work through some code problems with each potential hire.
  * Talk us through architecting a solution to a specific problem

During the 1st practical interview (2nd overall interview), we are not going to be asking you to recite obsure things from memory. What we are looking for are your problem solving skills. You are free to google anything you'd like. If you don't know the answer or how to solve it, that's alright. Talk us through your thinking and how you would go about solving a problem.

#### 3rd Interview - Let's make something (Senior person on the team) 

This interview isn't our 2nd practical interview (3rd overall interview), and it will focus on making something. These exercises vary based on the position, however, a few examples would be: 

* Write user stories based on a problem the user is trying to solve (PM)
* Write a search algorithm which will optimally find the shortest path to find a string (Engineering) 
* Build a wireframe for a set of user stories demonstrating the best UX and IA for the flow (Design)

# QA and release processes

These are general. Every project should `cp` this file into their project, call it `QA-RELEASES-PROCESS.md` and update it with specifics and information. 

Learn more about these processes in [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/qa-software-testing-training-course/)

## New Features

1. Branch develop into `feature/<feature-name>`.
2. Make changes.
3. Add changes made to CHANGELOG.md
4. Write new tests covering new features, or update tests to cover any changes you have made.
5. Ensure all tests are passing.
6. If develop has advanced beyond your current work, rebase your branch onto develop, fix any conflicts, and ensure everything is still working and tests are passing.
7. Make a PR on Github merging the branch back into develop.
8. Have the PR reviewed by someone else and have them merge things in.

## QA

Whether you are QAing a new release or just a new feature prior to merging it in, it is ideal to push the branch/release candidate up to the dev server.

## Releasing a new version of the product

Once all the features to be included in a version of the product have been merged into develop it is time to create a release candidate.

1. Make a new branch off of develop called `release/<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. And start the next version number in CHANGELOG.md for any future branches being merged in. Version numbers should use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
2. Ensure all tests are passing.
3. Push this branch up to the QA server, as detailed in the doc in the section above.
4. Have site QA'd for functionality and design.
5. If any bugs/issues are found branch off of the release branch, fix the issues and have the changes merged back into the release branch. Return to step 3. If no bugs/issues are found, proceed to step 6.
6. Push the site to staging.product.com. Details for this are also found in the server doc.
7. Have final release candidate QA'd and approved by Product Lead.
8. Follow step 5, if any bugs are found. If not, go to step 9.
9. Push new release to the live server. Details for doing this are in the server doc.
10. Merge the release branch back into develop.
